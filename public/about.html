<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, im david
  well, I'm Brazilian, I'm 23 years old, and here I'm trying to grow, life here is so difficult, and I have a dream to study physics, computer science, and maybe history. I don't know how this could be possible for me, I speak English at a medium level, but I can be in the conversation for an hour. I love languages, I speak a little bit of German, and Spanish, and now I'm learning Italian as well. 
I'm taking this serious, for me is like a dream to work as a nomad, and doing web dev, could make this posssile for me.
